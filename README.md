# Perceptual Characterization of speed differences during walking 

# data organization
Original data from the experiment (Datlog .mat files) were converted to .csv and made available. Resulting csv files ARE stored on each subject's /data/ subfolder. There are two types of files: the ones named 'BlockX.csv' store a table in csv format, and contain summary information about each of the 24 trials in each block. 
Original data from experiment (.mat files) will be made available upon request. 

# analysis
First, add the /src/ folder to Matlab's path.
The monoLS toolbox is also needed for some analyses, find at github.com/pabloi/monoLS and add to path.
