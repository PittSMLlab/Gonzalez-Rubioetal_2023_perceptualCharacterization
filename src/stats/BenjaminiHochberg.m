function [h,pThreshold,i1] = BenjaminiHochberg(p,fdr)
%Performs the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to determine significance in
%multiple comparisons while limiting the False Discovery Rate (number of false positives as a % of the number of total comparisons). This is a
%less taxing alternative to performing a Bonferroni correction, for
%example.
%
%INPUT:
%p= vector of p-values from the multiple comparisons, has to be 1-D
%fdr= value in [0,1] that determines the False Discovery Rate that is
%tolerated
%OUTPUT:
%h= binary vector that is 1 if the corresponding p-value was deemed
%significant, and 0 if not.
%pThreshold = value that ends up being the cut-off for p. Should satisfy:
%h=p<=pThreshold
%i1 = no. of significant results, equals sum(h)
